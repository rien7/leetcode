* [[id:2b2e3e1f-924b-43fe-a7f8-a1eb6482d2f2][问题]]
There are ~n~ gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ~i^{th}~ station is ~gas[i]~.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs ~cost[i]~ of gas to travel from the ~i^{th}~ station to its next ~(i + 1)^{th}~ station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays ~gas~ and ~cost~, return /the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return/ ~-1~. If there exists a solution, it is *guaranteed* to be *unique*

*Example 1:*

#+BEGIN_SRC
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
#+END_SRC

Example 2:

#+BEGIN_SRC
Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
#+END_SRC

*Constraints:*

- ~gas.length == n~
- ~cost.length == n~
- ~1 <= n <= 10^{5}~
- ~0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10^{4}~

* 思路
我好像特别不擅长做这种模拟类型的题目

=gas= 代表的是每一站能获得的油量, =cost= 代表的是从此站开到下一站需要的油量.

一个很容易理解的判断条件为: ~sum += gas[i] - cost[i]~, 如果最终 =sum < 0=, 则说明无法走完一圈.

但还需要判断的是从哪里开始走才能走完一圈, 这个问题问得是从某个地方开始, =curSum= 始终要大于 0

否则, 则说明当前 =start= 的位置不足以支持走完一圈, 需要将 ~start = i+1~. 这里分析一下为什么不是 ~start++~, 首先, start 能够在走了多站仍然不变, 说明 start 的位置的油量差必然大于 0, 那么如果在 ~cur + x < 0; cur > 0~ 的情况下减去 cur, 那么 x 必然小于0.

至于为什么不需要判断环, 是因为 =cost= 代表的是两站间的油耗.

* 代码
#+BEGIN_SRC go
func canCompleteCircuit(gas []int, cost []int) int {
    sum := 0
    for i := range gas {
        sum += gas[i] - cost[i]
    }
    if sum < 0 { return -1 }

    cur, start := 0, 0
    for i := range gas {
        cur += gas[i] - cost[i]
        if cur < 0 {
            start = i + 1
            cur = 0
        }
    }
    return start
}
