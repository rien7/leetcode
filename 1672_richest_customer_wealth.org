#+title: 1672. Richest Customer Wealth
#+filetags: :Easy:

* [[id:2b2e3e1f-924b-43fe-a7f8-a1eb6482d2f2][问题]]
You are given an ~m x n~ integer grid ~accounts~ where ~accounts[i][j]~ is the amount of money the ~i^{th}~ customer has in the ~j^{th}~​​​​ bank. Return /the *wealth* that the richest customer has./

A customer's *wealth* is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum *wealth*.

*Example 1:*

#+BEGIN_SRC
Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
#+END_SRC

Example 2:

#+BEGIN_SRC
Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.
#+END_SRC

Example 3:

#+BEGIN_SRC
Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17
#+END_SRC

*Constraints:*

- ~m ==accounts.length~
- ~n ==accounts[i].length~
- ~1 <= m, n <= 50~
- ~1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100~

* 思路
今天的题目没什么好说的, 两个循环即可

* 代码
#+BEGIN_SRC go
func maximumWealth(accounts [][]int) int {
    max := 0
    for _, acc := range accounts {
        sum := 0
        for _, v := range acc {
            sum += v
        }
        if sum > max { max = sum }
    }
    return sum
}
#+END_SRC
